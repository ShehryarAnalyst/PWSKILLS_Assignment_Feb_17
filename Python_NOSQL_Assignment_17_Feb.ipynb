    "__Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ans)__ MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format. Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, don't use traditional tables with rows and columns. MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases when dealing with large volumes of unstructured data, requiring flexibility and scalability, real-time processing, or an agile development cycle."

    "__Ans)__ MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database system that offers several key features that make it highly attractive for modern application development: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Document-oriented:__ MongoDB stores data as documents in a JSON-like format. This makes it highly flexible and easy to use, as data can be stored in a format that closely matches the way it will be used in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Dynamic Schema:__ MongoDB has a flexible schema that allows for changes to the data model without requiring a schema migration. This enables a faster development cycle and greater agility in adapting to changing business requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Scalability:__ MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers. It can easily handle large volumes of data and high levels of traffic, making it ideal for modern web and mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Indexing:__ MongoDB supports multiple types of indexing, including geospatial indexing, text search, and compound indexing. This allows for fast and efficient querying of data, even in large datasets."
